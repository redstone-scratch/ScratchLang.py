This is for people who want to use Scratch like other programming languages.

# Changes from upstream
- Made in Python
- ...thats it

The remainder of this README is just copied over from upstream.

# Latest big updates
Starting over and making a new decompiler.

# Open-Source
This is an open-source project. Anyone can contribute.

# The Plan
This is mainly made in Shell Script, but if you know languages like C and Python, then you can make some stuff in that so people have many options to choose from.

Some .sb3 files are included in the resources folder so you can test your comp/decomp scripts.

The compiler should read the testcode.ss1, write the project.json, and pack it and every asset into a .sb3, that can be played and edited in Scratch

Each sprite (including Stage) has a asset folder. The costumes and sound will go there. It also has a .ss1 file, which is where the code is.

A project.json is also included in the resources folder to help understand and reverse engineer how it's made. Although, there is pretty much nothing in it, so I recommend getting your own project.json

I'm programming the decompiler. First I'm gonna program it to decompile all the global and stage-exclusive blocks, then sprite-exclusive blocks.

## Contributing to the decompiler
If you want to help with the decompiler but you don't understand any of the code, just ask and I'll link a discussion explaining it. If there is no discussion, I'll create one.

## Notice
I am restarting the decompiler, because C-Blocks are added to the json really weird, and that makes a hurdle too tall to jump for decomiler V1. Maybe if you're a really advanced coder, you could get V1 to work with C-Blocks.

Also, I renamed the file extension to .ss1 because I am planning on having multiple formats.
ss1 Will be it's own language
ss2 Will be similar to c
ss3 Python or javascript?

# How to use
Download [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) if you're on Windows. <br />
Clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/0K9090/ScratchLang.git
cd ScratchLang/mainscripts
```

Start the project with
```
chmod 755 start.sh
./start.sh
```
If you create a scratchlang command, start the project wtih
```
scratchlang
```

To code, edit the .ss(es) in you favorite glorified text editor like VSC or Atom.

To add assets, put them in the "assets" folder for the chosen sprite (or stage)

You don't need ScratchLang to program ScratchScript (.ss) files, you can use a text editor. You just need ScratchLang to compile your project so it can run in Scratch.

# Dependencies
## Windows
You need `zenity`.
https://github.com/ncruces/zenity/wiki/Zenity-for-WSL%2C-Cygwin%2C-MSYS2 Download here, or you can run ./start.sh and input 5 to install zenity.

You also need `git`
```
pacman -S git
```
## Linux
You need the command `zenity` to run the .sh.
```
sudo apt-get install -y zenity
```
You also need `git`
```
sudo apt-get install -y git
```
Please write down any dependencies I missed.

# Jobs
This is what people will do.

I don't know what they're doing

# ScratchLang Language
ScratchLang's language is called ScratchScript. ScratchLang is the program that manages ScratchScript programs.
## ScratchScript blocks
\nscript - (Tells the compiler that it's a new script. Or maybe we could get rid of this and just detect for hat blocks.) <br />
**\prep - (Everything below this [until the next instance of \nscript] is used for compiling the .json)** <br />
list=item1,item2,item3,etc - (No spaces, and for an empty list, just add a comma after the equal sign.) <br />
**{broadcast}=broadcastexample - (Define a broadcast. The brackets tell the program that it is not defining a variable or a list.)** <br />
# Decompiler V2 Blocks
## Vanilla Scratch Blocks
### Added blocks
0/90 Stage Blocks + Pen | 0% Done <br />
0/141 Every Block + Pen | 0% Done <br />

Write every block in the order they are defined. <br />

Remember, quotes tell the compiler that it is not a variable. If you want to put in a variable, don't put quotation marks. <br />
Also, the compiler can't tell the difference between a string and a boolean/variable yet. So most number inputs have no quotation marks. <br />

Brackets means that there cannot be a variable in there. It's either a defined object or an object from a set list. <br />
### Very buggy blocks
None yet.

### Stable blocks
var=string - (Define [or set] a variable) <br />

# Decompiler V1 Blocks

### Added blocks
#### V1

Remember, quotes tell the compiler that it is not a variable. If you want to put in a variable, don't put quotation marks. <br />
Also, the compiler can't tell the difference between a string and a boolean/variable yet. So most number inputs have no quotation marks. <br />

Brackets means that there cannot be a variable in there. It's either a defined object or an object from a set list. <br />
### Very buggy blocks

### Stable blocks
var=string - (Define [or set] a variable) <br />
**list=item1,item2,item3,etc - (No spaces, and for an empty list, just add a comma after the equal sign.)** <br />
move ("num") steps (Move an amount of steps.) <br />
**wait ("num") seconds - (Wait for an amount of seconds.)** <br />
switch backdrop to ("backdrop") - (Changes backdrop.) <br />
**switch backdrop to ("backdrop") and wait -  (Changes backdrop and waits.)** <br />
next backdrop - (Changes backdrop by 1.)
**change [EFFECT #has to be in caps] effect by ("num") - (Change an effect by an amount.)** <br />
set [EFFECT] effect to ("num") - (Sets an effect to an amount.) <br />
**clear graphic effects - (Clears all effects applied to the stage or sprite.)** <br />
(backdrop [number/name]) - (Reports the number or name of the backdrop.) <br />
**play sound ("sound") until done - (Play a sound until done.)**
start sound ("sound") - (Start a sound.) <br />
**stop all sounds (Stop all sounds.)** <br />
change [EFFECT] effect by ("num") (Change an effect by an amount.) <br />
**set [EFFECT] effect to ("num") - (Sets an effect to an amount.)** <br />
clear sound effects - (Clear sound effects.) <br />
**change volume by ("num") - (Change the volume by an amount.)** <br />
set volume to ("num") % - (Set the volume to an amount.) <br />
**(volume) - (Reports the volume.)** <br />
when flag clicked - (When green flag clicked.) <br />
**when [key] key pressed - (Runs the script when a certain key is pressed.)** <br />
when stage clicked - (Runs the script when the stage is clicked.) <br />
**when backdrop switches to [backdrop] - (Runs the script when the stage changes to a certain backdrop.)** <br />

# Troubleshooting
## Variable or List taking a very long time to decompile?
The variable or list is probably long.
## Decompiler just stops or is outputting random junk
The decompiler is not complete yet, which means stuff like that will happen.

# Bugs
## V1 Decomp Bugs (This version is no longer being programmed.)
Loads broadcasts even if there are none. (Try decompiling decompilerteset.sb3 which is in the resources folder.)
## V2 Decomp Bugs
Since I copied the broadcast loading script to V2, it's safe to assume that the 1st bug for V1 can still happen in V2.
